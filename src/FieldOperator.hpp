/**
Class responsible for deploying point-wise (non-stencil-based) operations over
field variables. Services include converting arrays of conserved quanitites to
primitives and vice-versa, and determining the Courant condition for a patch
of data. Methods in this class must be agnostic to the mesh geometry, and thus
to the shape of the input data. However (at least for now) the input arrays
are assumed to have a layout where axes 0, 1, and 2 are spatial, while axis 3
has components of the primitive variable data.
