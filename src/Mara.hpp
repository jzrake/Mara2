that each class of algorithm is allowed to depend upon a subset of the other
algorithms. For example, if it were determined that a derived class of
BoundaryCondition, required use of a MeshGeometry instance, then the
MeshGeometry base class must inherit UsesMeshGeometry. This does not affect
other BoundaryCondition sub-classes, but the one which uses a MeshGeometry
must override the setRiemannSolver method. Algorithms are distributed in the
code's initialization stage based on inheritance of the base classes below.
